### 2. **Feed Management**
   - Log feed stock levels and track feed usage.
   - Generate alerts for low feed stock to prevent shortages.
   - Calculate daily feed requirements based on the number of birds and their growth stage.

### 3. **Egg Production Tracking**

   - Track quality and categorize eggs (e.g., large, medium, small).
   - Analyze egg production trends over time to optimize outputs.

### 4. **Financial Transactions and Expenses**
   - Record expenses (e.g., feed, labor, utilities) and income (e.g., egg sales, bird sales).
   - View detailed financial reports to assess profitability.
   - Generate daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly financial summaries.

### 5. **Health and Medication Tracking**
   - Track health records for each batch, including vaccination schedules.
   - Set reminders for scheduled vaccinations and medical checks.
   - Record medications administered to maintain health and prevent disease.

### 6. **Reports and Analytics**
   - Generate reports on bird population, feed consumption, egg production, and financials.
   - Visualize data through charts for quick insights into production and cost trends.
   - Export reports for record-keeping or sharing with stakeholders.

### 7. **User Roles and Access Control**
   - Secure system access with roles like Admin, Manager, and Employee.
   - Control access to sensitive data and limit permissions based on user roles.
